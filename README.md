### Project Description
AI Kudumbam ‚Äì Your Digital Dose of Family Drama is a fun web app where you can chat with your virtual Kerala family. Talk to the whole gang or individual characters like Amma, Ammayi, Ammavan, or Ammumma ‚Äî each bringing their signature advice, gossip, and love in perfect Manglish.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In today‚Äôs fast-paced world, many Malayalis living away from home are tragically deprived of the constant stream of unsolicited advice, probing questions, and overbearing affection that only a true Kerala family can provide. We saw this massive non-issue and decided it was time to bring back the drama ‚Äî digitally.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built AI Kudumbam, a gloriously unnecessary web app that lets you chat with a virtual Kerala family. Choose your favorite family member archetype ‚Äî Amma, Ammayi, Ammavan, or Ammumma ‚Äî and receive lovingly intrusive messages in authentic Manglish. Clean your room? They‚Äôll notice. Skipped lunch? They‚Äôll scold. It‚Äôs all the family drama you never needed, now available on demand.

# Diagrams
![Workflow](https://github.com/Sandra-004/AIKudumbam/blob/main/screenshots/ss4.png)
1. User‚Äôs Browser (Frontend)

    User interacts with the AI Kudumbam UI in their browser.

    The UI is the entry point for sending a request to start the group chat process.

2. Our Server (Python Backend)

    The browser sends a POST request to /api/group-chat.

    The backend then:

        Prepares the image (likely the room photo from the user).

        Shuffles personas so each persona will give a different, randomized reply.

3. Loop Over Personas

    For each persona in the shuffled list:

        The server sends the image and prompt to Google Gemini API via Google AI Cloud.

        Gemini returns a persona-specific response based on the image and instructions.

        This loop repeats for all personas in the set.

4. Final Output

    After all personas have responded, the results can be aggregated for the user in the frontend, simulating a family group chat where each persona reacts differently to the same image.

This is basically:

Frontend UI ‚Üí Backend API ‚Üí Persona Preparation ‚Üí AI Model Calls ‚Üí Responses Returned.
