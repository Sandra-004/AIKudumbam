### Project Description
AI Kudumbam ‚Äì Your Digital Dose of Family Drama is a fun web app where you can chat with your virtual Kerala family. Talk to the whole gang or individual characters like Amma, Ammayi, Ammavan, or Ammumma ‚Äî each bringing their signature advice, gossip, and love in perfect Manglish.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In today‚Äôs fast-paced world, many Malayalis living away from home are tragically deprived of the constant stream of unsolicited advice, probing questions, and overbearing affection that only a true Kerala family can provide. We saw this massive non-issue and decided it was time to bring back the drama ‚Äî digitally.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built AI Kudumbam, a gloriously unnecessary web app that lets you chat with a virtual Kerala family. Choose your favorite family member archetype ‚Äî Amma, Ammayi, Ammavan, or Ammumma ‚Äî and receive lovingly intrusive messages in authentic Manglish. Clean your room? They‚Äôll notice. Skipped lunch? They‚Äôll scold. It‚Äôs all the family drama you never needed, now available on demand.
